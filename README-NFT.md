## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

1. Use landmarks and be aware of accessibility rules especially in the images that I used. 
2. Incorporate my flexbox container into grid for easier centering
3. Use relative sizong to make the design adjustable based on the screen size. 


### Continued development

This is my third practice on flexbox. I am getting the hang of it but still lots of things to learn. I will focus more on using grid, simplifying my code and practice on changing pictues for mobile.
